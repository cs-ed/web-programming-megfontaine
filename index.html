    <p> I'm a secondary Math & Computer Science Teacher with 14 years of classroom experience. I've taught <br>
        all levels of high school math - from Algebra 1 through AP Calculus BC. I've been teaching introductory <br>
        AP Computer Science for 10 years. Outside of the classroom I enjoy hiking, travel, and a really great cappuccino.
